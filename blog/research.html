            >Rebalancing in Vehicle-sharing Systems with Service Availability
            Guarantees

          A station-based vehicle sharing system consists of a fleet of vehicles
          (usually bikes or cars) that can be rented at one station and returned
          at another station. We study how to achieve guaranteed service
          availability in such systems. Specifically, we are interested in
          determining a) the fleet size and b) a vehicle rebalancing policy that
          guarantees that a) every customer will find an available vehicle at
          the origin station and b) the customer will find a free parking spot
          at the destination station. We model the evolution of the number of
          vehicles at each station as a stochastic process. The proposed
          rebalancing strategy iteratively solves a chance-constrained
          optimization problem to find a rebalancing schedule that ensures that
          no service failures will occur in the future with a given level of
          confidence. We show that such a chance-constrained optimization
          problem can be converted into a linear program and efficiently solved.
          As a case study, we apply the proposed method to control a simulated
          bike-sharing system in Boston using real-world historical demand. Our
          results demonstrate that our method can indeed ensure the desired
          level of service availability even when the demand does not fully
          conform to the assumptions of the underlying stochastic model.
          Moreover, compared with a state-of-the art rebalancing method, the
          proposed method can achieve nearly full service availability while
          making less than half of the rebalancing trips.
