        Hi! I'm Tomas Roun. I currently work as a software engineer at CERN
        working at a great open-source tool, Indico. Besides programming, I'm
        interested in math, electronics and robotics. For many years I was an
        active of our university's Formula Student team (Student built racing
        cars). Our team competed in the self-driving category where we managed
        to score many victories. I've been with the team since the beginning.
        I'm also interested in Computer vision, robot navigation and mapping
        such as SLAM (I wrote my thesis on that). And it's currently used by our
        driverless formula.
